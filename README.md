# swhachey-portfolio-webdev

A Portfolio of Scott Hachey's work in Web Development and Full Stack Coding

This page was made with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. It is responsive to all sizes and devices. The navbar takes you to the different html files so the user can read about Scott Hachey, look at his portfolio of work, and contact him using a form. There is a sticky footer, and privately owned photo as background.

This project is finished for the time being, but will be updated with all my projects throughout the course of the the class.
